                        <li>
                            I am currently a senior in high school, so as I get into college, make new connections, and get jobs, I want to be able to show people a website I created that shows what I do. Plus, I want to go into computer science, so this could be a good place to display some of the projects I have done and even send this to some companies for CS internship applications.

                        <li>
                            I would love for employers to look at this website and be impressed. They are my main target audience, as I want to get exposure to more jobs and internships through this website.

                    </ul>

                    <ul class="sub-list">
                        <li>
                            Like I stated earlier, I would love for employers to see this website and become impressed. It already shows that I am familiar with web development because I would have coded the website myself, but I hope it is also organized in a great way that is appealing to employers.

                    <ul class="sub-list">
                        <li>
                            This website will contain information about my education (college and high school), my interests, and achievments. I will likely include info about my coding projects, coding awards, high school achievments (such as my GPA and academic honors), and my extracurricular activities like tennis and science competitions. I also want to include lots of media content like pictures and videos showcasing these things.
