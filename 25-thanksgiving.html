            <hr>
            <p>While theme parks do tend to be jam-packed during holiday weeks, including Thanksgiving, when most kids are out of school, many, like Disney World and Universal Studios, have extended hours that makes it easier to enjoy the rides and shows without battling massive crowds. Plus, at Disney World, you’ll find all sorts of options for Thanksgiving meals so you don’t have to miss out on the traditional feast. They’re typically offered at restaurants inside Downtown Disney as well as at many of the Disney resorts.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>Thanksgiving in the Smokies might be ideal if you’re looking for a mountain getaway. Gatlinburg is a beautiful gateway to the Great Smoky Mountain National Park and a popular destination for families all year long. You’ll find a wide range of vacation rentals, from cozy cabins to mountain chalets as well as numerous activities and events. The Great Smoky Thanksgiving and Christmas Arts and Crafts Show is the perfect place to pick up unique holiday gifts. Winter sports enthusiasts will want to drive to the top of Mount Harrison or take the aerial tramway that departs every 20 minutes from downtown to Ober Gatlinburg. Here you’ll find an ice skating rink, ski trails and a snow tubing lane, as well as gear available to rent.</p>

            <h2 style = "text-align: center;">Hawaii</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>While any time of the year is a great time to go to Hawaii, November is particularly good as it tends to be less overrun with tourists, offering a quieter time while still allowing you to enjoy that fabulous turkey dinner as most resort restaurants offer special meals for the holiday. While it does tend to be a rainier month, by choosing destinations on the dry side of the islands, generally the southern or western coasts of Kauai, like Poipu, Wailea on Maui, Kailua-Kon on the Big Island or Waikiki on Oahu, you’re likely to experience more idyllic weather. If you visit Waikiki, you can even watch its holiday parade, held the Friday after Thanksgiving each year. The parade commemorates Pearl Harbor by honoring survivors and veterans in memory of the attacks on December 7, 1941, with local Hawaiian bands, marching bands from the mainland and more.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>While you’ll have to bundle up and endure some chilly temperatures, Chicago offers all sorts of free holiday activities and attractions that make it a great place to be on Thanksgiving weekend. The festivities begin on Wednesday night when the mayor lights up the official Christmas tree. The next morning, the three-hour-long annual Thanksgiving Day Parade kicks off. One of the largest in the country, you’ll need to arrive early for a good spot as it starts early on State Street, working its way to Congress Parkway and Randolph Street, with a spectacle of giant helium balloons, award-winning marching bands, performance groups, equestrian units, dance troupes, local and national celebrities, rhythmic drum lines and more. Friday features the “wreathing of the lions” at the Art Institute of Chicago, and over at Millennium Park, visitors can enjoy ice skating and caroling.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>New Orleans is an exciting city known for partying and fabulous food, so it’s no surprise that they do up the Thanksgiving holiday right too. Along with po’ boys, crawfish and vignettes, New Orleans gave birth to a modern Thanksgiving tradition, the turducken. This triple-poultry dish is a chicken stuffed into a duck, stuffed into a turkey, and it can be savored at a number of local eateries. Deep-fried turkey is commonly served here too. You can also take in a great parade, with the Bayou Classic Thanksgiving Day Parade. The parade travels down Decatur Street, passing Jackson Square and Washington Artillery Park, ending at The French Market, where kids (and the kid at heart) can have their photo taken with Santa afterward. The next day, walk off all that food by attending the opening of Celebration in the Oaks at City Park, when trees are draped with hundreds of thousands of twinkling lights, and a train traverses for two miles through 25 acres of brilliant displays.</p>
